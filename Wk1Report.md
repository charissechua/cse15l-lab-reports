## Installing VS Code
1. Go online to the [VS code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the instructions to download it from there.
2. After downloading it you should be able to open up a blank file like this:

  This can be done by clicking *file* in the top left corner, and *New file*
(I had already installed VS code on my laptop before, so that is why there are other files open in the picture)

## Remotely Connecting 
1. Install [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
2. Open the terminal by clicking *terminal* -> *new terminal* or using keyboard shortcut Ctrl or Command + `
3. Type ```ssh cse15lwi22fff@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` (replace fff with the 3 unique letters of your ID. If you don't know your ID it can be found [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php))
4. There is a high chance that you will get a message that says 
```â¤‡ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?``
5. After typing yes it should prompt you to enter your password, and then this screen should appear:
